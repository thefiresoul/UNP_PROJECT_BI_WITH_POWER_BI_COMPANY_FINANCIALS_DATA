# UNP_PROJECT_BI_WITH_POWER_BI_COMPANY_FINANCIALS_DATA

I developed this Power BI project to analyze the financial performance of PeRRKKSS Pvt. Ltd. by creating dynamic dashboards and reports in Power BI Desktop. The analysis focused on visualizing sales, profitability, and discount trends across various segments, products, and countries for the period from September 2013 to December 2014. Through this project, I identified critical insights related to revenue growth, profit margins, discount strategies, and operational efficiency. Additionally, I provided data-driven recommendations to enhance profitability and optimize business performance.
