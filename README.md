# UNP_PROJECT_BI_WITH_POWER_BI_COMPANY_FINANCIALS_DATA

I completed this Power BI project to analyze the financial performance of PeRRKKSS Pvt. Ltd. by building interactive dashboards and reports. Using Power BI Desktop, I visualized sales, profitability, and discount data across various segments, products, and countries from September 2013 to December 2014. The project involved identifying key insights related to revenue growth, profit margins, discount impact, and operational efficiency, while also providing data-driven recommendations for improvement.
